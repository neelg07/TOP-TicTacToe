# TOP-TicTacToe
Tic Tac Toe game implemented using Javascript (TOP)

### Challenges Faced: 
- Using a new method for class/object implementation (factory func. and module pattern) was unfamiliar and difficult to get working properly.
- Setting up the dynamic and responsive UI to show each page/state change was tedious and confusing at times.
- Setting up event listeners for each tictactoe tile and updating each round based on the player's selection.
- Resetting the board in gameBoard object was not working properly. Fixed this by creating an entirely different method for creating a new board each match (i.e. createBoard() ). 
- Figuring out how to get the board to update properly after the first match.

### Comments: 
- The concept of this project was fun in general but proved to be more difficult as it progressed compared to the start. 
- It was fun and interesting creating the gameplay logic, thinking of the scenarios for winning, ties, etc. 
- This project furthered my knowledge in using JavaScript for dynamic and responsive web pages, as well as in using factory functions and the module pattern for creating objects.
- Overall, I might implement factory functions and composition over inheritence for certain cases, but personally I enjoy using classes and inheritance (introduced in ES6). I will more or less be using that due to familiarity classical OOP as seen in other languages.
